To build the JSI library from source, install maven and run the following:

% cd <location-of-pom.xml>
% mvn compile

This will generate two jar files; target/jsi-1.0.jar and target/jsi-test-1.0.jar. 
The second is only required for running tests, and is not needed for production use.

The following is a list of useful maven targets:
  o clean 
  o compile
  o test
  o -Dtest=ReferenceCompareTest_10000 test
  o package	
  o site
  o assembly:single (create package only)
  o site:deploy
  o deploy
