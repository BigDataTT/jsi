To build the JSI library from source, install Ant and run the following:

% cd <location-of-build.xml>
% ant all
  
This will generate two jar files; jsi/jar/jsi-1.0b5-DEV.jar and jsi/jar/jsi-test-1.0b5-DEV.jar. The second is only required for running tests, and is not needed for production use.
